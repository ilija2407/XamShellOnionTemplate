# XamShellOnionTemplate
Xamarin Forms application with onion architecture setup.

My motivation for starting this project is not creating a Xamarin application on steroids, instead moving my previous Xamarin template to a next level with implementing the onion architecture and Xamarin Shell.

<b>Why onion?</b>

By using Onion architecture, we can reach the separation of vital rules from the outer world's technologies. If we don't tangle into our business rules outer technologies, we can manage the change of technologies more easily. Architecture brings easier use of modern development approaches like Domain-Driven Design and Test-Driven Development.

Hope for help from many contributors...let's move this template to the next level!
